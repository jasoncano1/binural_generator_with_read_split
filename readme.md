# Brainwave Binaural Generator

A standalone HTML application for generating binaural beats across different brainwave frequencies with integrated spoken hypnosis capabilities.

## Overview

This application generates binaural beats by playing slightly different frequencies in each ear, creating a perceived "beat" at the difference frequency. This technique is used to potentially influence brainwave states for relaxation, focus, creativity, and more.

## Features

- **Multiple Brainwave Frequencies:**
  - Delta (0.5-4 Hz): Deep sleep, healing
  - Theta (4-8 Hz): Meditation, creativity, hypnotic states
  - Alpha (8-12 Hz): Relaxed alertness, flow state
  - Low Beta (12-15 Hz): Relaxed focus
  - Mid Beta (15-20 Hz): Active engagement
  - High Beta (20-30 Hz): Alertness, problem solving
  - Gamma (30-50 Hz): Higher cognitive processing

- **Carrier Frequency Options:**
  - 200 Hz (traditional)
  - 1000 Hz (alternative)
  - Custom frequency selection (100-2000 Hz)

- **Text-to-Speech Hypnosis:**
  - Custom script input
  - Voice selection
  - Speed and volume controls
  - Pre-loaded quantum coding/manifestation script

## Usage

1. **Setup:**
   - Open the HTML file in any modern web browser
   - Connect headphones (required for binaural effect)

2. **Basic Operation:**
   - Select desired brainwave type
   - Choose carrier frequency
   - Adjust volume
   - Click "Start" to begin

3. **Hypnosis Function:**
   - Start binaural beats
   - Customize the script if desired
   - Select voice and reading speed
   - Click "Read Script" to begin narration

## Best Practices

- Use stereo headphones for proper binaural effect
- Start with short 10-20 minute sessions
- Theta waves (4-8 Hz) work best for hypnosis and deep relaxation
- Alpha waves (8-12 Hz) are ideal for creative work and focused relaxation
- Beta waves support active mental work and problem solving

## Technical Details

- Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Uses the Web Speech API for text-to-speech
- Uses Tone.js for high-quality audio synthesis
- No installation required - runs entirely in browser
- Works offline after initial load

## Notes

Scientific research on the effectiveness of binaural beats for specific cognitive states is ongoing. Results may vary between individuals.
